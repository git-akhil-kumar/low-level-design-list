/** 
 * The Observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that 
 * allows you to define or create a subscription mechanism to send 
 * notifications to multiple objects about any new events that 
 * happen to the object they're observing. The object that is 
 * being watched is often called the subject. The objects that 
 * are watching the state changes are called observers or listeners. 
 * 
 * Two most significant elements
 * 
 * Subject: This is the object which is being observed. 
 *              It maintains a list of observers and provides 
 *              methods to modify that list.
 * 
 * Observer: The objects which are watching the state changes 
 *              are known as observers or listeners. They provide a 
 *              method to update that is used by Subject.
