Behavioral design patterns are responsible for efficient communication and 
the assignment of responsibilities among objects. They focus on how objects 
interact and communicate with each other, as well as how the flow of control
is organized within a system. These patterns define the protocols for 
communication between objects and help in distributing responsibilities to 
ensure that the system is efficient, maintainable, and scalable.
